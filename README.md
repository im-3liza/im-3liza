Hi! ðŸ‘‹

# I'm Liyana Aliei, a passionate Web Designer & Developer

I have hands-on experience in **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma, SCSS, and JavaScript**. Additionally, I possess foundational knowledge in **Python** and **Django**, which allows me to approach projects from a full-stack perspective.

Driven by a genuine love for programming, Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I believe that continuous growth and curiosity are the keys to becoming a better developer.

I enjoy crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces that provide great user experiences. Collaboration, attention to detail, and problem-solving are at the core of my work ethic.

Whether working on small personal projects or more complex applications, I stay committed to delivering quality and learning from every challenge.
